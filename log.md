**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

**Today's progress**: #100DaysOfCode

Day 6/100

Moved a loginButton component to the navbar component using JS and React.

Had to rework the default button to use a styled button custom button component built by my teammate.

Might have a merge conflict to sort out.

**Thoughts**: This is easing me into the frontend. I made a new git branch to work out of.
